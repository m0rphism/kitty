# Examples & Case Studies

In this directory, we collect examples and case studies related to our framework.

Each subdirectory contains a formalization of a programming language:

-   [SystemF-Simple](SystemF-Simple) contains a standalone simplified
    version of the framework and a formalization of *subject
    reduction* for *System F*.

-   [SystemF](SystemF) contains a formalization of *subject
    reduction* and *progress* for *System F* using the full framework.

-   [SystemFSub](SystemFSub) contains a formalization of *subject
    reduction* for *SystemF Sub*, i.e. *System F* extended with
    subtyping bounds.

-   [SystemFSub-Alt](SystemFSub-Alt) contains an alternative
    formalization of *subject reduction* for *SystemF Sub*, where
    subtyping is modelled not as a separate relation, but directly
    in the typing relation.

-   [LambdaPi](LambdaPi) contains an
    formalization of *subject reduction* for a dependently typed
    lambda calculus with dependent function types, dependent pair
    types, and an equality type.

-   [Patterns](Patterns) contains an
    formalization of *subject reduction* for a simply typed lambda
    calculus with pattern matching, product types, sum types, unit
    type, and empty type.

  \begin{abstract}
    Variable binding and substitution are a long-standing nuisance for mechanized
    metatheory of programming languages. A common approach is to represent
    variables as DeBruijn Indices, where substitution is defined in terms of
    variable renaming. If a language has $n$ different kinds of variables, and
    $m$ different kinds of terms, we potentially need to define both
    renaming and substitution for all $m\cdot n$ combinations and prove the
    theory of those operations both in isolation and with respect to each other.

    % McBride introduced kits to define both substitution and renaming by a
    % single term traversal for intrinsically typed terms.\cite{mcbride2005kits}

    We propose a technique to derive the implementation and metatheory of
    renaming and substitution for all $m\cdot n$ combinations of variables and terms
    from a single term traversal and three simple lemmas for extrinsically typed
    but intrinsically scoped terms.
    We demonstrate this technique by formalizing type soundness of System F with
    very parallel substitutions, which replace both type and term variables at
    once, enabling a single substitution-preserves-typing lemma.
    We provide a well-documented implementation of the technique as an Agda
    library.

    As the technique is based on extrinsic typing, the metatheory of renaming
    and substitution is decoupled from type preservation.
    This has the downside, that type preservation of renaming and substitution
    are not for free, but also the upside, that the library can be directly
    instantiated for object languages with non-standard typing relations like
    dependent types, type state, or resource environments.

  \section{Introduction}
  Formalizing metatheory of programming languages in a proof assistant 
  requires to deal with variables, binders and substitution.

  In most languages those constructs behave uniformly,
  i.e. substitution is only concerned with variables and binders and
  behaves homomorphic on all other syntax constructors.

  Intrinsic typing 


  \begin{enumerate}
  \item DeBruijn
  \item Intrinsic vs Extrinsic
  \item Reduction under binder
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Structure}
  The rest of this paper will introduce our framework using System F
  as a running example for a type soundness proof.

  Code of the framework is displayed in gray boxes.
  Code of examples is written in yellow boxes.
  Code of the System F formalization is written without boxes. This is
  the only code a user of our framework has to write.

  In the paper we state all definitions and lemmas, but omit some proofs
  in the interest of space. However the omitted proofs exclusively
  depend on lemmas and definitions stated in this paper. The full code
  from the paper can be found at TODO.

  In the paper we only show the part of the framework necessary for
  the System F soundness proof. The actual implementation is more
  general and complete and can be found at TODO.

  \subsection{Contributions}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item

  \item
    a multi-sorted extension of McBride's kits to unify renamings and substitutions and their metatheory;
  \item

  \section{Syntax}
  The following shows a typical intrinsically-scoped syntax of System F:
  \ExampleCode\FUnsortedSyntax

  \texttt{Type}s are indexed by the number of free type variables \texttt{n}.
  \texttt{Expr}essions are additionally indexed by the number of free expression variables \texttt{m}.
  Variables are represented as DeBruijn-indices, where \texttt{Fin n} is the type of \texttt{n} elements.

  This style of syntax comes with multiple drawbacks:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bad scaling for automation
  \item Multiple substitions require interaction lemmas
  \end{itemize}

  % Instead we define a single term type which is indexed by the sort of
  % syntax, i.e.\ whether the term is a kind, type, or expression:
  To avoid these drawbacks, we define a single term type \texttt{S~‚ä¢~s} that is indexed by its sort \texttt{s},
  i.e.\ whether the term is a kind, type, or expression, and the sorts of its free variables \texttt{S}:

  For example a term of type \texttt{[ùï•, ùï•] ‚ä¢ ùïñ} is an expression (\texttt{ùïñ}) with two free type-variables (\texttt{ùï•}).
  \LibCode\KSortTy

  \AppCode\FSort


  \LibCode\KVariables
  \AppCode\FSyntax
  The variable constructor \texttt{'\_} takes a sorted DeBruijn-index \texttt{S~‚àã~s}.
  Since the \texttt{Sort}s in \texttt{S} are restricted to the sort-type \texttt{Var}, it is not possible to construct kind-variables.

  \section{Renamings \& Substitutions}
  \subsection{Multi-Sorted Renamings \& Substitutions}
  Working with a sort-indexed syntax allows us to define renamings and substitutions
  which replace all variables of all sorts simultaneously:

  \ExampleCode\FExampleSubRen

  A renaming \texttt{S‚ÇÅ ‚Üí·µ£ S‚ÇÇ} maps variables from \texttt{S‚ÇÅ} to
  variables from \texttt{S‚ÇÇ}.
  A substitution \texttt{S‚ÇÅ ‚Üí‚Çõ S‚ÇÇ} maps variables from \texttt{S‚ÇÅ} to
  terms in \texttt{S‚ÇÇ}.

  \ExampleCode\FExampleSub

  This representation has the benefit that there is no combinatory
  explosion of substitutions and renamings, e.g.\ no extra lemmas have to be
  proved between an expression-in-expression and a type-in-expression
  substitution, because both are simply substitutions.

  \subsection{Unifying Renamings \& Substitutions}
  A well-known problem with DeBruijn-indices is that full substitution
  cannot be defined directly by structural recursion on the term.
  The typical workaround is to define renamings and substitutions
  separately and use renamings to weaken the terms in substitutions
  when going under binders.

  While this keeps lemmas simple (requiring only structural induction),
  it duplicates the amount of work as all operations and lemmas have
  to be defined and proved for both renamings and substitutions.

  To avoid this duplication,
  McBride\cite{DBLP:journals/jar/BentonHKM12,
  unpublished:mcbride2005kits} introduced \emph{Kits} - an abstraction
  which allows to talk about both renamings and substitutions
  simultaneously.

  The core idea behind kits is that renamings and substitutions only
  differ in what they return:
  \ExampleCode\FExampleSubRen

  In both cases \texttt{\_‚àã\_} and \texttt{\_‚ä¢\_} are instanciated to type
  \texttt{List (Sort Var) ‚Üí Sort Var ‚Üí Set}, so we can create a structure
  to axiomatize the common theory behind both of them.

  \section{Typing}
  % TODO move to typing section
  The only drawback we found, is that types can now also be indexed
  with free expression variables, even though types can never contain
  free variables as assured by the variable constructor. However, this
  only causes minor issues.
